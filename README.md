# Year 12 Major Work: Compost Management App

## Project Description
This software is for gardeners to schedule and manage their compost bins. It includes a simple user interface, created on pygame, where the users can see what bins they need to flip on the main page. The bins are filtered using colours (a key is included), and new bins can be created by clicking on the plus button. Users can click on the calendar to select the initial creation date of the bin. 

### Justification of Technologies Used
I decided to create the user interface on pygame as I have had some previous experience with it. It allowed me to build upon my skills and utilise different features of the technology.

### Challenges I Faced
Time Management (for Part A/Coding): This was partially due to the large size of the project with a small time frame (around 6 weeks). To ensure that my time was used efficiently and effectively, I used available AI tools like Chat-GPT to build the majority of my user interface, which I had the least experience building. I also didn't include some features within my project, such as a log-in page and an insights page, as this wasn't the main focus of my project. 

### Features To Implement in the Future
- Log-in page to ensure data privacy and security
- Insights page to show productivity and bins flipped
