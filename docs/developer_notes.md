# Developer Notes

Description:This document is a record of regular (weekly) uodates to my prroject. It will describes the current task I am doing, any challenges I am facing, and upcoming goals/steps to do.

### Term 1 Week 11
Monday 08 April
- Received unofficial MW assessment notification
- Started putting together this documentation (Part B)

### Term 2 Week 3
Monday 13 May
- Worked on part B documentation:

    Documentation
    List and briefly explain 3 types of documentation that is essential for the software solution. Explain the purpose of each type of documentation and how you have implemented it.

    Documentation is an essential part of the software solution, especially in communicating ideas to clients and stakeholders. This can be presented in different ways, such as a log book document, user manual, and documentation strings or code commenting. 

    Log-Book Documentation
    A log book document, such as this one, is a helpful tool to explain and justify the choices made within the software development cycle. This could involve specific areas such as legal, social and ethical considerations that have been addressed while building the project, or creating a criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the project in solving the required problem. 

    Furthermore, I have consistently tracked my progress in a markdown file (developer_notes.md). This is a record of regular (weekly) updates to my project. It describes the current task I am doing, any challenges I am facing, and upcoming goals/steps to do. This allows me to record ideas and reflect on the process and speed of development of the project. More so, it can act as proof of concept, progression and all my own work if required by a teacher or other stakeholders. 
    User Manual
    Clients may have trouble accessing, updating or using the project, as they may not have the required knowledge or experience to do so. Thus, it is useful and important to include a user manual; a document provided to a user that helps in using a particular system, product or service seamlessly. 

    I have implemented this documentation within my own project to help my client (Sona Dsouza) use the software efficiently and effectively in order to schedule and track her composting. 
    Documentation Strings (Code Comments)
    Software developers use code comments to describe the code to and for developers. The main intended audience are the maintainers and developers of the Python code. In conjunction with well-written code, comments help to guide the reader to better understand your code and its purpose and design. 

    Code comments are helpful in all stages of development:
    Planning and reviewing: When developing new portions of code, it may be appropriate to first write and use comments as a way of planning or outline that section of code. These comments can be later removed once the actual code has been implemented and reviewed/tested.
    Code Description: Comments can be used to explain the intent of specific sections of code
    Algorithm Description: When algorithms are used, especially complicated ones, it can be useful to explain how the algorithm works or how its implemented within your code. It may also be appropriate to describe why a specific algorithm was selected over another. 
    Tagging: Tagging can be used to label specific sections of code where known issues or areas of improvement are located. Some examples are: BUG, FIXME, and TODO. 

    I have utilised these commenting techniques within my own project, especially during the planning, development and execution of the written code. 
- Created python files for modules (schedule, tracker, display, archive) and main file
- Started working on "Legal, Social and Ethical Considerations"
- TODO: Legal, Social and Ethical Considerations
