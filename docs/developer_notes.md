# Developer Notes

Description: This document is a record of regular (weekly) uodates to my prroject. It will describes the current task I am doing, any challenges I am facing, and upcoming goals/steps to do.

### Term 1 Week 11
Monday 08 April
- Received unofficial MW assessment notification
- Started putting together this documentation (Part B)

### Term 2 Week 3
Monday 13 May
- Worked on part B documentation:
- Created python files for modules (schedule, tracker, display, archive) and main file
- Started working on "Legal, Social and Ethical Considerations"
- TODO: Legal, Social and Ethical Considerations

Wednesday 15 May
- Worked on part B documentation:
- Completed "Legal, Social and Ethical Considerations"

Thursday 16 May
- Worked on part B documentation:
- Completed "Project Management"
- Started working on "Schedule Module"

### Term 2 Week 4
- Worked on part B documentation - collaborative approach

### Term 2 Week 5
Thursday 30 2024
- Worked on part B documentation - user interface design, evaluation
- Worked on code - used chat gpt to help with creating schedule and tracking functions
   
### Term 2 Week 6
- Worked on archive function
- TODO: check if track and archive functions work. create a list of predetermined dates as input
- TODO: need to create pygame user interface

### Term 2 Week 7
Thursday 13 June 
- Worked on pygame interface
- reflected on design and started coding a new interface

Friday 14 June
- Continued working on user interface 
- Implemented a key on main page
- Displayed the bins on main page after creating 
- TODO: display function to change the colour of the bins depending on today's date and the date bin needs to be flipped
- TODO: archive function that saves past bins to a folder?

### Term 3 Week 8
Monday 17 June
- Updated README.md file
 
Wednesday 19 June
- Asked for feedback and help from my Dad:
    -  He told me to write the full code in english pseudocode and fill it out with what I had
    - The layout of code was messy and hard to read
- Wrote an outline for pseudocode for user interface:

Thursday 20 June
- Worked on pygame user interface

- Asked for help and feedback from my Dad:
    - Worked through code logic originally written in logic_functions.py
    - Used ChatGPT to help implement a clear, working terminal based logic - working_logic.py
        - Implemented classes to encapsulate data and functionality into objects. 
            - The class function CompostBin tracks multiple bins simultaneously. It provides functionality to calculate flip schedules, add flip dates, check completion status, and generate string representations of the bins.
            - The class BinArchive represents an archive of completed compost bins. It adds bins to the archive and retrieves the archive is wanted by the user. This functionality manages the archive separately from the active bins, keeping the code organised and modular. 
        - Benefits of using classes (generated by ChatGPT):
            - Encapsulation: Classes allow us to encapsulate related data and functionality, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
            - Reusability: Once a class is defined, it can be reused to create multiple instances, reducing code duplication.
            - Modularity: Classes promote modularity by breaking down the program into smaller, more manageable components (objects).
            - Abstraction: Classes allow us to abstract away the complexity of the implementation details, making it easier to work with the objects.
    - Used ChatGPT to create a pygame user interface:
        - Pygame was slow and difficult to work with
        - We decided due to lack of time and slow software that this could just be a feature to improve on in the future
- Updated dev notes
- updated README file
- Updated file names
- Went through assessment task notification and checked through objectives:
    - Implementation was guided by original modelling diagrams in assessment task 1 
    - However, code deviated from original plan for user interface due to limited time frame, skills and lack of working software (including runtime of pygame)
    - Code comments were implemented throughout logic and older, working version of user interface to demonstrate knowledge of standard and custom algorithms
    - GenAI developed code has been clearly declared and justified
